# interscan

**interscan** is designed to distribute the process of scanning the entire internet across a distributed cluster of linux servers.

It works on top of [masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan), adding an abstraction layer for sharding and distributing the scanning workload across multiple nodes.
